              <strong>Response:</strong>	          			
                 Three years ago my dad found his life’s work in shambles in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida. Bryan Bascle is a machinist who shapes raw metal material into working mechanical parts. It’s grueling and dirty work. After high school, he began his trade as a craftsman working for another machining company. He started his own company when he was laid off, trading in his boat for his first machine. Hurricane Ida hit in 2021, and the shop was torn in half. Now, the light pours in as he works out a shop with missing walls and often flooded floors. Ida may have destroyed his shop, but never his resolve. He works day and night to keep his business afloat and rebuild the shop that shaped his life. 
                    The name “Steel and Grit” is meant to depict the rough, unpolished nature of the industrial environment he works in, as well as the resilience, durability, and toughness of his enduring spirit. It’s the intersection of his physical environment with his personal qualities.
                    The photos are a variety of traditional portraits, setting shots, and close-ups of the work he does. The color blue is prevalent throughout the photos to pay tribute to the hard, demanding work of blue-collar workers and evoke a more hopeful, determined mood.  The images showcase the aftermath of the hurricane, including missing walls, torn-up tarps, and rusted wreckage. They are characterized by rough textures. They display the tools he uses, the parts he makes, and the repairs he’s conducting. But most importantly, they present my dad, who—in the face of life’s challenges— demonstrates as much steel and grit as that which he crafts.
