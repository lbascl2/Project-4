    <h2> Who am I?</h2>
    <p> For now, I'll just share this about me I had to write for a journalism class talking about how we picked what we were studying. I first began storytelling as a 10-year-old acting on the stage. While
      I won’t be pursuing life as an actress because I prefer a more stable
      career, I won’t be abandoning my creative side either.
      During my senior year of high school I discovered the visual arts
      and a new way to tell stories through color, lines and forms. I took a
      graphic design class and looked forward to it every day. My older
      brother also worked as a graphic designer. I sat behind him to
      watch him work. I was fascinated by the way he beautified the
      ordinary. I decided that’s what I want to do too.
      Now, I’m an art major and mass communications minor with a
      focus in advertising. I want to use the skills I learned to visually
      communicate the stories of people and companies in beautiful
      ways.
      
      
      My time at LSU has taught me to convey ideas clearly and
      intentionally. Plenty of projects pushed me out of my comfort zone
      and shyness to meet new people and learn about and appreciate
      their stories, such as one photography project where we had to
      walk up to strangers and ask to photograph them.
      In the past I’ve worked as a volunteer for my church making graphics and advertisements. I will be redesigning the website over winter
      break. I hope to apply for a position with the LSU magazine in future semesters. For my long-term goals, I want a job I can put my heart
      into, working for a company whose values and goals I cherish.
      While I might not be on Broadway like I originally planned, I’ll still be storytelling.</p>
